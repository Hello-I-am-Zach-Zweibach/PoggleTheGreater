Hello ðŸ‘‹ my name is Zachary Zweibach and I am a senior year computer science student attending USF.

Hello, my name is Zachary Zweibach.

My passion for programming brought me to University of South Florida, where I am working on my Bachelor's in Computer Science.
I've always been interested in learning various fields inside computer science. 
This past semester, for instance, I took courses in quantum computing, hardware security, and computational geometry. 
This year, I hope to complete an internship in software engineering that will provide me with relevant experience and skills.
To help meet this goal, I have been familiarizing myself with Github by uploading a few thing to work on.
